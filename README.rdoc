Simple reminder system for ringley tech test

= How does it works

You will find the reminder in lib/ringley_reminder.rb, it is fully configurable,
check the code of reminder_controller#index of the sample rails app I provide.

You can add as many new rules you want, setting their due time with a simple ActiveSupport
Date object (1.month, 1.day, (1.week - 1.day), ...)

  rules =
  [
    { :period => 'quarterly',    :time => 1.month },
    { :period => 'twice_a_year', :time => 2.month }
  ]

  reminder = RingleyReminder.new(rules)

  check_date = Date.strptime('01/01/2013', '%d/%m/%Y')
  estates = ['0066S', '0123S', '0250S']

  reminders = reminder.on(check_date, estates)

= Start

  git clone git@github.com:htatche/ringley_reminder.git
  cd ringley_reminder
  rails s
  Open your browser and go to localhost:3000/reminder
  Finnally, you can add as many new estates and due dates you want on localhost:3000/charges

To use it in another rails app, just grab the migration files from db/migrate and do:

  rails g model Charge
  rake db:migrate:all (this will create the charges table)

You could also run it in a console app just doing require 'active_record' and setting the database connection.

= Tests

Just run rake test !
This will create the test database and feed it with db/fixtures/charges.yml

- Test file for ReminderController was auto-generated by rails g scaffold reminders, I didn't push it further because is out of scope of this tech test.

- The RingleyReminder class has it's own test file, that is the important one !
